I need to fix the message popup in the admin panel and change how messages are displayed in the table.

**Current Issues (Image shows):**

1. **Popup Problems:**
   - Currently shows "Message from neesha" popup when clicking message column
   - Popup displays "No special requests" even when user sent a message
   - "Close" button in the popup is NOT working
   - This popup format is not what we want

2. **Table Display Issue:**
   - In the admin panel table, the "Message" column always shows "No special requests"
   - Actual messages sent by users are not displaying in the table
   - Messages should be visible directly in the table, not hidden behind a popup

**Required Changes:**

**PART 1 - Fix Message Display in Table:**
- The "Message" column in the admin panel table should display the ACTUAL message text sent by the user
- If user sent "late coming" → Table should show "late coming"
- If user sent "Running 5 mins late" → Table should show "Running 5 mins late"
- If user sent no message → Table should show "No special requests"
- Messages should be visible directly in the table row WITHOUT needing to click anything

**PART 2 - Change Popup Behavior:**
- When admin clicks on the Message column, instead of current popup, show:
  - **Title:** "You got a message from [Customer Name]" (e.g., "You got a message from neesha")
  - **Message Content:** Display the actual message text the user sent
  - **Buttons:** 
    - "Mark as Read" button
    - "Close" button ← Make sure this works properly

**PART 3 - Fix Close Button:**
- The "Close" button in the popup is currently not working
- Fix the onClick handler for the Close button
- Clicking "Close" should dismiss/hide the popup properly

**Expected Behavior:**

1. **In Table View:**
   - Customer "neesha" sent message "late coming"
   - Admin sees in table: Message column shows "late coming" (not "No special requests")

2. **When Clicking Message:**
   - Popup appears with title: "You got a message from neesha"
   - Popup shows message content: "late coming"
   - "Mark as Read" button works
   - "Close" button closes the popup properly

3. **If No Message:**
   - Table shows: "No special requests"
   - Clicking opens popup: "You got a message from [Customer Name]"
   - Popup content: "No special requests"

**Technical Requirements:**
- Fetch and display actual message data in the table
- Update popup title to include customer name dynamically
- Display actual message content in popup
- Fix Close button event handler to properly close/dismiss the popup
- Ensure "Mark as Read" functionality still works
- Make sure the popup is responsive and looks good

Please implement these changes to properly display user messages in both the table and popup.
