We have an admin panel with two sections: Active Queue and Recent Activity.
The existing booking and queue functionality is already implemented and should not be broken or changed.

Current Problem

Currently, when a user fills in the booking details, the data appears correctly in the Active Queue section.
The admin then calls the user, and when the user accepts the seat, the data disappears from the admin panel.

After seat acceptance, the entry is not visible in Active Queue and also not visible in Recent Activity.
This means the system is either deleting the record or not storing it properly after confirmation.

Expected Behavior
1. Active Queue Behavior

When a user books a seat, their details should appear in Active Queue.

When the user clicks “I’m Coming”, the entry should also appear in Active Queue (without affecting existing booking flow).

When the user accepts the seat, the entry should still remain in Active Queue until the admin confirms it.

2. Confirm Flow

When the admin clicks the Confirm button from Active Queue:

The entry should be removed from Active Queue.

The same entry should be moved and stored in Recent Activity with status = CONFIRMED.

3. Cancel Flow

If a seat is cancelled (by user or admin):

The entry should be stored in Recent Activity with status = CANCELLED.

4. Recent Activity Behavior

Recent Activity must show all historical queue records, including:

Confirmed bookings

Cancelled bookings

No confirmed or cancelled data should be deleted from the database.

Important Requirements

Do not break existing booking and queue logic.

Only extend and fix the flow so data is not lost.

Use a status-based system (example: PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED) instead of deleting records.

Ensure the admin panel correctly reflects:

Active Queue → only PENDING records

Recent Activity → CONFIRMED and CANCELLED records

Goal

Fix the issue where confirmed seats disappear and ensure all queue actions are permanently stored and visible in Recent Activity, while keeping existing functionality intact.
